# weekly-web-work

## Objectives

- Get moving
- Overcome inertia
- Start building things instead of just keeping them in my head
- Stop obsessing about what's the bEsT tool to use
- Overcome overthinking

## Key results

- Start and publish at least 1 web app each week for the rest of 2020

### Notes

- This week is Week 39. I have 13 weeks to go. 13 apps to build
- The web app can be absolutely about anything and can be as simple as I'd like. The only criteria is that it needs to be started and done within a week.
- Each app will need to be accompanied by a blog post
- Parts of each app can be used to build another app
